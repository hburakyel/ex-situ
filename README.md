Overview

Ex-Situ is a research and archival project that aims to create a cartographic visualization of the digital collections of museums in Europe and North America, focusing on the migration of artefacts from diverse cultures in the Global South. The project collects hyperlinks from various institutional websites and geolocates the migration of these artefacts, establishing connections not only to the physical movements of artefacts but also to digital spaces like web domains. Ex-Situ reappropriates and exposes museumsâ€™ collection policies, contextualizing and re-presenting practices for the digital age.
